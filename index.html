      This site is hosted to allow for ease in listenting police scanner audio streams.  Use of police scanners makes for a neat hobby, however, the startup cost can be great.  That is where this site comes in; so sit back, relax, and enjoy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently this site provides access to 2 audio streams as well as links to find more and become involved in this hobby.  Check below the streams to see more information.  <b>Please SHARE this site!</b>

      CNU Audio Stream:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The first audio stream is that of Christopher Newport University (CNU) Police Department; CNU is a small liberal arts college in Newport news, Virgina.  The scanner station is located approximately 1 mile from the tower.  CNUPD is on the City of Newport News digitally trunked (P25) system.

  <h3>
    Hobby Information:
  </h3>
  This portion will be updated as I develop my skills in this hobby.
  <br>
  <br>
  First and formost, one of the great resources is the following site: <a href="http://www.radioreference.com/">Radio Reference</a>.  The two main important peices of the site is the Database section, and the Wiki.  
  <br>
  <br>
  For now, take a look around there and become familiar with some terminology.
  My personal preference for purchases of the scanners is Amazon where I was able to purchase a WS1040 (made by Whistler) and that is what is currently behind the CNU Stream.  The Newport News stream is using a Radio Shack Pro-106.
  <br>
  <br>
  Note that the Hampton Roads area is on an APCO P-25 system, meaning that it is Digitally Trunked and so the scanner must support that technology.  However, a cheap scanner may be used to pickup the local fire department simulcasts, aircrafts, ATC, and even a fast food drive-thru!
